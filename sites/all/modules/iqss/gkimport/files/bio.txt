most important theoretical contributions" to the discipline "from its

used in as many states by these groups, and in many other practical
contexts.  His contribution to methods for achieving cross-cultural
comparability in survey research have been used in surveys in over
eighty countries by researchers, governments, and private
concerns. King led an evaluation of the Mexican universal health
